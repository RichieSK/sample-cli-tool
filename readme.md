# Sample CLI Tool

## Introduction

`Sample CLI Tool` is a command-line interface tool designed to learn how to create a basic CLI tool while learning JavaScript and node. This is a barebones implementation that does nothing for now.

### Notes for windows users using it in CMD
1) To use in debug mode:
set DEBUG=* & tool --start

2) tool --start (to run the program. Repl)

### Notes to myself regarding windows CLI
1) To create and open a file: notepad filename.txt

2) To delete a file: del filename.txt
